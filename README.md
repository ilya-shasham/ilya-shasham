# About me
Why hello there! The name's Ilya, as it's apparent from the username.
I'm a junior Go developer with experience in backend web developement.

I've also had some experience with python in my even earlier days, but
not enough for me to be comfortable calling it one of my main go-tos.

# Interests

- socket programming
- REST APIs
- encryption
- server management
